# Heart_-disease__Prediction_Model
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death globally, making early diagnosis and prevention crucial for saving lives. The Heart Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on various health parameters.

This Machine Learning project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in patients using clinical and demographic data. Heart disease is a critical health issue worldwide, and early detection plays a key role in reducing mortality rates. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying patients at risk.

The project utilizes a publicly available dataset (such as the UCI Heart Disease dataset), which contains features like age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, and more. These features are used to train and test various classification algorithms.

Objectives:

Analyze and preprocess medical data.

Apply supervised machine learning algorithms for classification.

Evaluate model performance using standard metrics.

Build a simple UI for user interaction (optional).

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries/Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC

Optional: Flask/Streamlit for web deployment

Outcome: A trained ML model capable of predicting whether a person is likely to have heart disease, based on key health indicators. The system can be extended for real-world use in clinical decision support systems or health apps.
